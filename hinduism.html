            <h1>Hinduism</h1>
            <p>Major world religion originating on the Indian subcontinent and comprising several and varied systems of philosophy, belief, and ritual. Although the name Hinduism is relatively new, having been coined by British writers in the first decades of the 19th century, it refers to a rich cumulative tradition of texts and practices, some of which date to the 2nd millennium bce or possibly earlier. If the Indus valley civilization (3rd–2nd millennium bce) was the earliest source of these traditions, as some scholars hold, then Hinduism is the oldest living religion on Earth. Its many sacred texts in Sanskrit and vernacular languages served as a vehicle for spreading the religion to other parts of the world, though ritual and the visual and performing arts also played a significant role in its transmission. From about the 4th century ce, Hinduism had a dominant presence in Southeast Asia, one that would last for more than 1,000 years. In the early 21st century, Hinduism had nearly one billion adherents worldwide and was the religion of about 80 percent of India’s population. Despite its global presence, however, it is best understood through its many distinctive regional manifestations.</p>

            <h2>Nature of Ultimate Reality</h2>
            <p>For Hindus, God has three main features. Firstly, God is Antaryami, or Brahman (the Ultimate Reality or truth). Secondly, God is the Lord within a person’s heart, or all-pervading Antaryami. Many Hindus meditate on Antaryami in order to be aware of Brahman. Meditating on Antaryami helps to bring balance and realisation of God. Thirdly, Hindus view God as Bhagavan or Ishvara, a supreme being who lives beyond the world. Many Hindus believe that they can develop a personal and direct relationship with Bhagavan. They also believe that Bhagavan possesses qualities that include knowledge and strength.</p>

            <h2>Origin and Purpose of the World</h2>
            <p>The term Hinduism became familiar as a designator of religious ideas and practices distinctive to India with the publication of books such as Hinduism (1877) by Sir Monier Monier-Williams, the notable Oxford scholar and author of an influential Sanskrit dictionary. Initially it was an outsiders’ term, building on centuries-old usages of the word Hindu. Early travelers to the Indus valley, beginning with the Greeks and Persians, spoke of its inhabitants as “Hindu” (Greek: ‘indoi), and, in the 16th century, residents of India themselves began very slowly to employ the term to distinguish themselves from the Turks. Gradually the distinction became primarily religious rather than ethnic, geographic, or cultural. Since the late 19th century, Hindus have reacted to the term Hinduism in several ways. Some have rejected it in favor of indigenous formulations. Others have preferred “Vedic religion,” using the term Vedic to refer not only to the ancient religious texts known as the Vedas but also to a fluid corpus of sacred works in multiple languages and an orthoprax (traditionally sanctioned) way of life. Still others have chosen to call the religion sanatana dharma (“eternal law”), a formulation made popular in the 19th century and emphasizing the timeless elements of the tradition that are perceived to transcend local interpretations and practice. Finally, others, perhaps the majority, have simply accepted the term Hinduism or its analogues, especially hindu dharma (Hindu moral and religious law), in various Indic languages. Since the early 20th century, textbooks on Hinduism have been written by Hindus themselves, often under the rubric of sanatana dharma. These efforts at self-explanation add a new layer to an elaborate tradition of explaining practice and doctrine that dates to the 1st millennium bce. The roots of Hinduism can be traced back much farther—both textually, to the schools of commentary and debate preserved in epic and Vedic writings from the 2nd millennium bce, and visually, through artistic representations of yakshas (luminous spirits associated with specific locales and natural phenomena) and nagas (cobralike divinities), which were worshipped from about 400 bce. The roots of the tradition are also sometimes traced back to the female terra-cotta figurines found ubiquitously in excavations of sites associated with the Indus valley civilization and sometimes interpreted as goddesses.</p>

            <h2>Origin, Nature, and Purpose of Humans</h2>
            <p>Hinduism is the third-largest religion with over 870 million followers and is considered the oldest practiced religion, dating back to around 5000 BCE. Unlike Christianity or Islam, it developed from a mix of traditions and philosophies. Its main scriptures are the Vedas, Upanishads, and Bhagavad Gita. Hindu creation stories are diverse, without a single clear origin. A common belief is in a supreme god whose different aspects appear as various deities. The Trimurti—Brahma (creator), Vishnu (preserver), and Shiva (destroyer)—represent the cycle of creation and destruction. Brahma is said to create all life, sometimes with help from his sons, the Prajapati. The concept of god in Hinduism is complex, with gods seen as powerful beings (Devas). Some texts even suggest the universe existed before the gods. Overall, Hindu creation beliefs are varied and often symbolic.</p>

            <h2>Source of Sacred Knowledge</h2>
            <p>Hinduism’s sacred texts are central to its beliefs and practices. The **Vedas**—Rigveda, Yajurveda, Samaveda, and Atharvaveda—are ancient hymns and prayers believed to be divinely revealed to sages, containing guidance on rituals and laws. The **Upanishads**, part of the Vedas, explore deep philosophical and metaphysical ideas and are the foundation of Hindu thought. The **Bhagavad Gita**, a key spiritual text from the Mahabharata, is a dialogue between Arjuna and Krishna, emphasizing duty, peace, and detachment. The **Ramayana** tells the story of Rama, an avatar of Vishnu, and his rescue of Sita, while the **Mahabharata** is a vast epic detailing a dynastic war and moral struggles. Together, these texts reflect the core values, traditions, and philosophies that shape Hinduism today.</p>
            
            <h2>Nature and Means of Salvation</h2>
            <p>In Hinduism, salvation—called Moksha (or Nirvana in Buddhism)—is the ultimate goal of life. It means freedom from the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, and union with the Supreme Soul. The soul (Atma) is eternal and takes on new bodies based on past karma. This cycle continues until salvation is achieved. Only human beings can attain Moksha, which is why human life is considered precious. Salvation doesn’t require renouncing everyday life—one can pursue it while fulfilling social and family duties. The four goals of life are Dharma (duty), Artha (wealth), Kama (desire), and Moksha, with Moksha being the highest. The soul evolves over many lifetimes, learning and progressing toward liberation. Even if salvation isn't reached in this life, spiritual efforts carry forward and help the soul move closer to Moksha in future lives.</p>

            <h2>Ethics and Morality</h2>
            <p>The ethics of Hinduism are rooted in a set of core moral principles that guide individual behavior and spiritual growth. These principles, commonly known as the Panchavrata or Five Vows, form the foundation of ethical conduct not only in Hinduism but also in related religions like Buddhism and Jainism. The five key values include Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (truthfulness), Asteya (non-stealing), Brahmacharya (self-restraint), and Aparigraha (non-possessiveness). Each of these plays a critical role in helping individuals lead disciplined, compassionate, and morally sound lives. These ethical values are not merely abstract ideals but are deeply woven into the scriptures and teachings of Hinduism. Texts like the Rigveda, Bhagavad Gita, Manu Smriti, and Yoga Sutras of Patanjali all highlight the importance of living virtuously. For instance, the Bhagavad Gita outlines a broad spectrum of virtues such as humility, forgiveness, and self-control, while the Yoga Sutras emphasize moral disciplines (Yamas) that are essential to spiritual practice. The goal of these ethical teachings is to help individuals progress spiritually while maintaining harmony in society. Ethics in Hinduism are not just personal responsibilities but are seen as universal values necessary for peaceful coexistence. By adhering to these principles, individuals are believed to purify their minds, reduce attachment and ego, and ultimately move closer to liberation (Moksha). Thus, Hindu ethics serve as a practical and philosophical guide to living a balanced and meaningful life.</p>

            <h2>Nature and Purpose of its Community</h2>
            <p>The social structure of Hinduism is traditionally organized around several key systems, each contributing to the functioning of society and maintaining order. The Varna System and the Jati System form the backbone of this structure, with the former focusing on broad social classes and the latter delving into more specific caste divisions. The Varna System classifies society into four primary groups: the Brahmins, who are priests, scholars, and teachers responsible for spiritual guidance; the Kshatriyas, who are warriors and rulers tasked with governance and protection; the Vaishyas, who are merchants, traders, and agriculturalists, focusing on economic activities; and the Shudras, who are artisans and laborers serving the other three classes. This system, though broad, lays the foundation for societal roles and duties in traditional Hindu society. However, the Jati System goes beyond the Varna classification by creating numerous sub-groups or castes based on occupation, community, and regional identity. These castes are more specific and culturally diverse, varying from one region to another, creating a complex web of social stratification that affects many aspects of life. In addition to these societal divisions, the Joint Family System plays a central role in Hindu social organization. Traditionally, Hindu families are extended or joint, with multiple generations living together under one roof. This structure allows for a collective approach to economic, social, and religious duties, strengthening family bonds and creating a support system across generations. Finally, in rural areas, the Village and Panchayat System operates as a form of local governance. Panchayats, councils of elders, are responsible for settling disputes and managing community affairs. This ancient self-governing system continues to function in various forms today, reflecting a long-standing tradition of decentralized decision-making. Together, these systems—Varna, Jati, the Joint Family, and the Panchayat—form the foundation of social order in traditional Hindu society. While they have evolved over time, these structures continue to influence cultural and social practices within Hindu communities.</p>

            <h2>Nature of the Afterlife</h2>
            <p>Hinduism presents a profound understanding of the afterlife, emphasizing the eternal nature of the soul and the cyclical journey of rebirth influenced by one's actions. Central to this belief is Samsara, the continuous cycle of birth, death, and reincarnation, where the soul, or Atman, transmigrates into new forms based on accumulated **karma**. Positive actions can lead to more favorable rebirths, while negative actions may result in less favorable circumstances. Upon death, the soul's journey is guided by Yama, the god of death, who assesses the individual's deeds and directs them to Naraka (hell) or Svarga (heaven). These realms are not permanent; souls undergo purification before being reborn. The ultimate aim is to achieve Moksha, liberation from the cycle of rebirth, leading to a state of eternal bliss and unity with the divine. This liberation is attained through living a life of righteousness, fulfilling one's duties, and accumulating positive karma. Hindu afterlife beliefs underscore the importance of moral conduct and spiritual growth, offering a framework that connects actions in this life with consequences in future existences. Understanding these beliefs provides insight into Hindu perspectives on life, death, and the pursuit of liberation.</p>
