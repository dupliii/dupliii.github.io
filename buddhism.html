            <h1>Buddhism</h1>
            <p>Buddhism, one of the major world religions, began in India around the 6th century B.C.E. It spread throughout Asia and is now practiced worldwide. Shakyamuni, also known as Siddhartha Gautama, was born around 490 B.C.E. in a royal family. He renounced luxury to seek enlightenment and became the Buddha. Buddhists believe in reincarnation, karma, and the Dharma (teachings of the Buddha). The goal is to attain enlightenment and be free from suffering. Nirvana is the ultimate goal, signifying freedom from suffering and the cycle of rebirth. It is achieved by eliminating greed, hatred, and ignorance.</p>

            <h2>Nature of Ultimate Reality</h2>
            <p>In Mahāyāna Buddhism, particularly in Madhyamaka philosophy (Nāgārjuna), ultimate reality is understood as emptiness. This concept does not mean "nothingness," but rather the absence of independent existence. All things arise due to causes and conditions, making them empty of inherent, permanent nature. The core Buddhist teaching is that all phenomena arise and cease based on conditions, reinforcing the ideas of impermanence and non-self (Anattā). Buddhism rejects the notion of a singular, eternal ultimate reality, focusing instead on interdependence and the impermanent nature of existence. Nibbāna is the unconditioned state, representing the cessation of suffering, where attachment and duality are transcended, leading to a deeper understanding of reality.</p>

            <h2>Origin and Purpose of the World</h2>
            <p>In Buddhism, the nature and purpose of the world are understood through the concepts of impermanence, suffering, and interconnectedness.
                <ul>
                <li>Impermanence (Anicca):</li> The world is in a constant state of change, with nothing permanent. Understanding impermanence helps reduce attachment to transient things and encourages acceptance of life’s inevitable changes.
                
                <li>Suffering (Dukkha):</li> The world is inherently marked by suffering—physical, emotional, and existential—caused by attachment to impermanent things and ignorance of the true nature of reality. Recognizing suffering motivates the pursuit of liberation from it.
                
                <li>Interconnectedness (Pratītyasamutpāda):</li> All phenomena are interconnected and interdependent; nothing exists in isolation. This understanding fosters compassion, mindfulness, and wisdom, reminding individuals that their actions affect both themselves and others.
                
                <li>Samsara (Cycle of Birth and Rebirth):</li> Beings are trapped in the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, driven by ignorance and desire. The goal is not to remain in samsara but to transcend suffering through the Eightfold Path, ultimately reaching Nirvana.
                
                <li>Nirvana:</li> The ultimate goal is the cessation of suffering and the end of samsara. It represents the realization of the true nature of reality, free from ego, desire, and attachment.</p>
                </ul>

            <h2>Origin, Nature, and Purpose of Humans</h2>
            <p>In Buddhism, the nature and purpose of humans revolve around understanding the impermanent and dynamic aspects of existence, overcoming suffering through self-transformation, and cultivating compassion and wisdom to ultimately achieve liberation (Nirvana) from the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth (Samsara).</p>

            <h2>Source of Sacred Knowledge</h2>
            <p>Buddhism's sacred texts are a diverse collection of scriptures that preserve the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha. These texts were originally transmitted orally by Buddhist monastics before being written down in various Indo-Aryan languages. Over time, they were compiled into distinct canons, with the most influential being the Pāli Canon in Theravada Buddhism and the Mahayana Sutras in Mahayana Buddhism. The Pāli Canon, or Tipiṭaka, is the foundational scripture of Theravada Buddhism and is divided into three parts: the Vinaya Piṭaka (rules for monastic life), the Sutta Piṭaka (discourses of the Buddha), and the Abhidhamma Piṭaka (philosophical and doctrinal analyses). These texts are considered the earliest and most authoritative in Buddhism, providing a comprehensive guide to Buddhist teachings and practices. In contrast, Mahayana Buddhism includes additional texts called the Mahayana Sutras, which offer expanded teachings and practices. These texts reflect the more diverse and inclusive nature of Mahayana Buddhism, emphasizing the path of the bodhisattva and the ideal of universal liberation. As Buddhism spread across Asia, these texts were translated into languages such as Chinese and Tibetan, leading to the development of regional canons and interpretations. The sacred texts of Buddhism, whether from the Theravada or Mahayana tradition, offer deep insights into the philosophy, ethics, and spiritual practices that have shaped Buddhist thought and continue to guide practitioners today.</p>

            <h2>Nature and Means of Salvation</h2>
            <p>​In Buddhism, the term "salvation" differs from its common religious connotation of being saved from sin. Instead, Buddhism focuses on liberation from the root causes of suffering: greed, hatred, and delusion. This liberation is achieved through the attainment of Nirvana, a state of freedom, emancipation, and release from the cycle of rebirth and suffering. Central to Buddhist practice is the Eightfold Path, a guide to ethical conduct, mental discipline, and wisdom. This path involves right understanding, intention, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and concentration. By following this path, individuals work towards overcoming attachment and ignorance, leading to the realization of Nirvana.​ In essence, Buddhism teaches that liberation comes from within, through personal effort and insight, rather than external salvation from sin. The ultimate goal is to achieve a state of non-attachment and inner peace, free from the defilements that cause suffering. ​</p>

            <h2>Ethics and Morality</h2>
            <p>The main goal of Buddhist practice is to reach freedom from suffering by coming to see the world as it actually is and abandoning the distorted projections that our thoughts and emotions create. A very important means to reach this goal is to refrain from destructive actions, since these actions cause harm to others and create mental disturbances in us that generate suffering and keep us from seeing things as they are. Moreover, according to Buddhist teachings, those who reach the goal of freedom thenceforward act in a loving and compassionate manner towards others, helping these others in turn to be more happy and free. Ethical action is thus both an important part of the Buddhist path and an important aspect of the results said to flow from that path.</p>

            <h2>Nature and Purpose of its Community</h2>
            <p>Theravādin Buddhists doesn't follow a strict social hierarchy. They live freely, use regular services, and can live wherever they choose. If they live in places with large Buddhist communities, they might use Buddhist-run services, like schools or hospitals, but this is a personal choice. Lay Buddhists help support monks and nuns by providing the essentials they need, like food, clothes, shelter, and medicine. This support allows monks and nuns to focus on their meditation and spiritual practices. In return, monks and nuns teach and guide laypeople on their spiritual paths. In Buddhism, everyone is equal and focused on their own journey to spiritual growth. While they aim for personal enlightenment, they also show compassion and mindfulness towards others.</p>

            <h2>Nature of the Afterlife</h2>
            <p>Buddhism teaches that after death, individuals undergo rebirth, entering a new existence influenced by their actions (karma) in previous lives. This process is part of the continuous cycle of samsara, characterized by ongoing cycles of birth, death, and rebirth. The nature of one's rebirth—whether as a human, animal, ghost, demigod, or deity—is determined by the moral quality of their actions in past lives. Rebirth into human form is considered particularly auspicious, offering a valuable opportunity to break free from samsara and achieve Nirvana, the ultimate liberation from suffering and the cycle of rebirth. Central to this belief is the concept of karma, which posits that intentional actions have consequences that influence future circumstances. Through ethical living, cultivation of wisdom, and mental discipline, individuals aim to accumulate positive karma, leading to more favorable rebirths and, ultimately, the attainment of Nirvana. Therefore, in Buddhism, death is viewed not as an end but as a transition within the ongoing cycle of samsara, with the potential for spiritual progress through successive lifetimes.</p>
