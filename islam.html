            <h1>Islam</h1>
            <p>Islam is one of the major religions in the world. It originates from Saudi Arabia from around 7th century CE and founded by Prophet Muhammad. The word Islam in Arabic means “surrender”. Allah is viewed as their sole God, creator, sustainer, and restorer of the world. In Islam Muhammad is considered the last of the series of prophets (including Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Solomon, and Jesus) and his message simultaneously completes the “revelations” attributed to other prophets. Islam starts when Muhammad received his first revelation. Through his life he continued to receive messages from God and he began to preach what he had learned. His main message that there is no other God but Allah and that people should lead their lives in a way that was pleasing to God. There are currently 1.2 billion Muslims in the world where 7 million are from United States, and the largest Muslim populations are in Indonesia and India. Only about 18% of Muslims are Arabs and live in Middle East. </p>

            <h2>Nature of Ultimate Reality</h2>
            <p>In Islam, ultimate reality is centered on the belief in Allah (God) as the sole deity, as encapsulated in the idea of Tawhid (God's Oneness). Allah is unique, merciful, all-knowing, and the universe's solitary creator. The aim of creation is to glorify Allah and follow His instructions, as revealed in the Quran and via the Prophet Muhammad. Muslims believe in life after death, including resurrection and judgment, which leads to either Paradise (Jannah) or Hell. The Quran is the ultimate source of knowledge about reality, and developing a personal relationship with Allah via prayer and worship is necessary for comprehending this ultimate truth. Establishing a personal contact with Allah is crucial for comprehension and experience. Muslims practice frequent prayers (Salah), supplications (Dua), and acts of worship, all of which help them feel purposeful and connected. Zakat (charity) and Sawm (Ramadan fasting) promote community, self-discipline, and compassion for others.</p>

            <h2>Origin, Nature, and Purpose of Humans</h2>
            <p>Islam is fundamentally aligned with humanity’s true nature, as both the Qur'an and hadith affirm that human beings are created to submit to God.  This submission is a reflection of both the natural law and humanity's purpose, not only a religious practice. In Islam, spiritual guidance focuses on establishing oneself into harmony with God, other people, and the natural world by aligning oneself with God's will. According to the Quran, people who adhere to Islamic truth are on the right path, and those who depart from it live contrary to their original destiny.</p>

The Quran is the central religious text of Islam. It represents the fountainhead of Divine guidance for every Muslim. The Islamic sacred book is the words of God and was dictated to Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, by the Archangel Gabriel and was written down in Arabic. The Sunnah is made up of the traditions and practices of the Prophet Muhammad.</p>
